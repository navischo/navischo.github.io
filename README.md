### Hello and welcome to the original adventure!

## Introduction

Somewhere nearby is a mysterious factory that has no name, where on holidays you can see crowds of people in dark raincoats and strangely shaped glasses. Rumor has it that some of the people who enter are never seen again. They say that magic works in the factory. This program will become your eyes and hands.

This program was originally developed by Yehor Navischo in Kyiv. Green House Art Residency provided all the necessary resources for the development of this game during a full-scale Russian invasion to the territory of the sovereign state of Ukraine. The game is based both on my favorite board games: Munchkin, Scythe, Fights of Battle Mages - and computer games: Cyberpunk 2077, Colossal Cave Adventure.
This version was implemented using JS+HTML+CSS and can be started from any modern browser.
